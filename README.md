Automated Flappy Bird Game using Neural Networks and the NEAT algorithm. Game will start with a set amount of birds given a set population size. The birds that make it the furthest through the game will have an increased fittnes which will influence the bird to continue jumping and passing through the pipes. This model uses a reinforcement learning approach and combines the principles of neural networks and evolutionary computation. Also uses Pygame to bring the game to life. 

# NEAT
- NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm that uses artificial neural networks to evolve solutions for complex problems. It starts with a population of simple neural networks and evolves them over generations. NEAT employs a technique called speciation, which encourages diversity in the population by grouping similar neural networks together. This helps to explore different solutions and prevents premature convergence. The algorithm allows for the addition and removal of nodes and connections in the neural networks, enabling the evolution of both the structure and weights of the networks. Through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation, NEAT iteratively refines the neural networks to find increasingly better solutions to the problem at hand.
